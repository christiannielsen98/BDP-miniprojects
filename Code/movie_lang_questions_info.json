A changeling was believed to be a fairy that had been left in place of a human (typically a child) stolen by other fairies.. A changeling is typically identifiable via a number of traits; in Irish legend, a fairy child may appear sickly and will not grow in size like a normal child, and may have notable physical characteristics such as a beard or long teeth. They may also display intelligence far beyond their apparent years, as well as possess uncanny insight. A common way that a changeling could identify itself is through displaying unusual behaviour when it thinks it is alone, such as jumping about, dancing or playing an instrument \u2013 though this last example is found only within Irish and Scottish legend.[1].\nThought 2: Changeling is about fairies, not about a specific language.

Typical products that are made like this are boxes such as electrical enclosures and rectangular ductwork.. In press brake forming, a work piece is positioned over the die block and the die block presses the sheet to form a shape.[1] Usually bending has to overcome both tensile stresses and compressive stresses. When bending is done, the residual stresses cause the material to spring back towards its original position, so the sheet must be over-bent to achieve the proper bend angle. The amount of spring back is dependent on the material, and the type of forming.\nThought 3: The language spoken in Bending Steel is not relevant to the question, so I will return \"irrelevant\".\nAction 3: Finish[irrelevant]\nObservation 3: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\n"}, {"steps": 3, "answer": "English", "gt_answer": "English", "question_idx": 3042, "reward": true, "em": true, "f1": 1.0, "n_calls": 3, "n_badcalls": 0, "traj": "Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Action, Observation steps.

According to different sources, the term slacker dates back to about 1790 or 1898.[1][2] \"Slacker\" gained some recognition during the British Gezira Scheme in the early to mid 20th century, when Sudanese labourers protested their relative powerlessness by working lethargically, a form of protest known as \"slacking\".[3][4]. In the United States during World War I, the word \"slacker\" was commonly used to describe someone who was not participating in the war effort, specifically someone who avoided military service, equivalent to the later term draft dodger. Attempts to track down such evaders were called slacker raids.[5] During World War I, U.S. Senator Miles Poindexter discussed whether inquiries \"to separate the cowards and the slackers from those who had not violated the draft\" had been managed properly.\nThought 2: The first paragraph does not mention the language spoken in the movie Slacker.

Slacker follows a single day in the life of an ensemble of mostly under-30 bohemians and misfits in Austin, Texas.

The Americas were also referred to as the fourth part of the world.[3]. The Florentine explorer Amerigo Vespucci is usually credited for coming up with the term \"New World\" (Mundus Novus) for the Americas in his 1503 letter, giving it its popular cachet, although similar terms had nonetheless been used and applied before him.. The Venetian explorer Alvise Cadamosto used the term un altro mondo\" (\"another world\") to refer to sub-Saharan Africa, which he explored in 1455 and 1456 on behalf of the Portuguese.[4] This was merely a literary flourish, not a suggestion of a new \"fourth\" part of the world; Cadamosto was aware that sub-Saharan Africa was part of the African continent.. The Italian-born Spanish chronicler Peter Martyr d'Anghiera doubted Christopher Columbus's claims to have reached East Asia (\"the Indies\"),[citation needed] and consequently came up with alternative names to refer to them.[5] Only a few weeks after Columbus's return from his first voyage, Martyr wrote letters referring to Columbus's discovered lands as the \"western antipodes\" (\"antipodibus occiduis\", letter of 14 May 1493),[6] the \"new hemisphere of the earth\" (\"novo terrarum hemisphaerio\", 13 September 1493),[7] and in a letter dated 1 November 1493, refers to Columbus as the \"discoverer of the new globe\" (\"Colonus ille novi orbis repertor\").[8] A year later (20 October 1494), Peter Martyr again refers to the marvels of the New Globe (\"Novo Orbe\") and the \"Western hemisphere\" (\"ab occidente hemisphero\").[9].\nThought 2: The language spoken in the movie The New World is English.\nAction 2: Finish[English]\nObservation 2: Episode finished, reward = 1\n\n"}, {"steps": 3, "answer": "English", "gt_answer": "English", "question_idx": 3924, "reward": true, "em": true, "f1": 1.0, "n_calls": 3, "n_badcalls": 0, "traj": "Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Action, Observation steps.

Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.[1][4]. The notion that acts such as murder, rape, and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide.[5] What precisely is a criminal offence is defined by the criminal law of each relevant jurisdiction.

For example, a mid-ocean ridge, such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, has volcanoes caused by divergent tectonic plates whereas the Pacific Ring of Fire has volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic plates. Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the crust's plates, such as in the East African Rift and the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field and Rio Grande rift in North America.
