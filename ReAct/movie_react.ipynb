A changeling was believed to be a fairy that had been left in place of a human (typically a child) stolen by other fairies.. A changeling is typically identifiable via a number of traits; in Irish legend, a fairy child may appear sickly and will not grow in size like a normal child, and may have notable physical characteristics such as a beard or long teeth. They may also display intelligence far beyond their apparent years, as well as possess uncanny insight. A common way that a changeling could identify itself is through displaying unusual behaviour when it thinks it is alone, such as jumping about, dancing or playing an instrument – though this last example is found only within Irish and Scottish legend.[1].\n",

Being awake is the opposite of the state of being asleep in which most external inputs to the brain are excluded from neural processing.[1][2][3][4]. The longer the brain has been awake, the greater the synchronous firing rates of cerebral cortex neurons. After sustained periods of sleep, both the speed and synchronicity of the neurons firing are shown to decrease.[5]. Another effect of wakefulness is the reduction of glycogen held in the astrocytes, which supply energy to the neurons.\n",

Inspired by the farces of the ancient Roman playwright Plautus (254–184 BC), specifically Pseudolus, Miles Gloriosus, and Mostellaria, the musical tells the bawdy story of a slave named Pseudolus and his attempts to win his freedom by helping his young master woo the girl next door. The plot displays many classic elements of farce, including puns, the slamming of doors, cases of mistaken identity (frequently involving characters disguising themselves as one another), and satirical comments on social class. The title derives from a line often used by vaudeville comedians to begin a story: \"A funny thing happened on the way to the theater\"..

      "Observation 2: Bending is a manufacturing process that produces a V-shape, U-shape, or channel shape along a straight axis in ductile materials, most commonly sheet metal.[1] Commonly used equipment include box and pan brakes, brake presses, and other specialized machine presses. Typical products that are made like this are boxes such as electrical enclosures and rectangular ductwork.. In press brake forming, a work piece is positioned over the die block and the die block presses the sheet to form a shape.[1] Usually bending has to overcome both tensile stresses and compressive stresses. When bending is done, the residual stresses cause the material to spring back towards its original position, so the sheet must be over-bent to achieve the proper bend angle. The amount of spring back is dependent on the material, and the type of forming.\n",

Set in the period 1784–1789, the film portrays Jefferson when he was US minister to France at Versailles before the French Revolution.

Having acquired the film rights to the Nelson-penned short story prior to the production of They Live, Carpenter used the story as the basis for the screenplay's structure, which he wrote under the pseudonym \"Frank Armitage\". Carpenter has stated that the themes of They Live stemmed from his dissatisfaction with the economic policies of then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan, as well as what Carpenter saw as increasing commercialization in both popular culture and politics.[2] In 2017, in response to misreadings of the film's themes, Carpenter further clarified that the film \"is about yuppies and unrestrained capitalism\".[c].\n",

The English word derives from the French word saboter, meaning to \"bungle, botch, wreck or sabotage\"; it was originally used to refer to labour disputes, in which workers wearing wooden shoes called sabots interrupted production through different means. A popular but incorrect account of the origin of the term's present meaning is the story that poor workers in the Belgian city of Liège would throw a wooden sabot into the machines to disrupt production.[1].\n",

      "Observation 1: Days of Heaven is a 1978 American romantic period drama film written and directed by Terrence Malick, and starring Richard Gere, Brooke Adams, Sam Shepard and Linda Manz.[4] Set in 1916, it tells the story of Bill and Abby, lovers who travel to the Texas Panhandle to harvest crops for a wealthy farmer. Bill persuades Abby to claim the fortune of the dying farmer by tricking him into a false marriage.. Days of Heaven was Malick's second feature film, after Badlands (1973), and was produced on a budget of $3 million. Production was particularly troublesome, with a tight shooting schedule in Canada in 1976 and significant budget constraints. Film editing took Malick a lengthy two years, due to difficulty with achieving a general flow and assembly of the scenes.\n",

Two species are placed in the genus, the green iguana, which is widespread throughout its range and a popular pet, and the Lesser Antillean iguana, which is native to the Lesser Antilles. Genetic analysis indicates that the green iguana may comprise a complex of multiple species, some of which have been recently described, but the Reptile Database considers all of these as subspecies of the green iguana.[5][6].

      "Observation 1: A slacker is someone who habitually avoids work or lacks work ethic.. According to different sources, the term slacker dates back to about 1790 or 1898.[1][2] \"Slacker\" gained some recognition during the British Gezira Scheme in the early to mid 20th century, when Sudanese labourers protested their relative powerlessness by working lethargically, a form of protest known as \"slacking\".[3][4]. In the United States during World War I, the word \"slacker\" was commonly used to describe someone who was not participating in the war effort, specifically someone who avoided military service, equivalent to the later term draft dodger. Attempts to track down such evaders were called slacker raids.[5] During World War I, U.S. Senator Miles Poindexter discussed whether inquiries \"to separate the cowards and the slackers from those who had not violated the draft\" had been managed properly.\n",

      "Action 1: Search[The New World]\n",
      "Observation 1: The \"New World\" is a term often used for the majority of Earth's Western Hemisphere, specifically the Americas.[1] The term gained prominence in the early 16th century, during Europe's Age of Discovery, shortly after the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci concluded that America represented a new continent, and subsequently published his findings in a pamphlet he titled Mundus Novus.[2] This realization expanded the geographical horizon of classical European geographers, who had thought the world consisted of Africa, Europe, and Asia, collectively now referred to as the Old World, or Afro-Eurasia. The Americas were also referred to as the fourth part of the world.[3]. The Florentine explorer Amerigo Vespucci is usually credited for coming up with the term \"New World\" (Mundus Novus) for the Americas in his 1503 letter, giving it its popular cachet, although similar terms had nonetheless been used and applied before him.. The Venetian explorer Alvise Cadamosto used the term un altro mondo\" (\"another world\") to refer to sub-Saharan Africa, which he explored in 1455 and 1456 on behalf of the Portuguese.[4] This was merely a literary flourish, not a suggestion of a new \"fourth\" part of the world; Cadamosto was aware that sub-Saharan Africa was part of the African continent.. The Italian-born Spanish chronicler Peter Martyr d'Anghiera doubted Christopher Columbus's claims to have reached East Asia (\"the Indies\"),[citation needed] and consequently came up with alternative names to refer to them.[5] Only a few weeks after Columbus's return from his first voyage, Martyr wrote letters referring to Columbus's discovered lands as the \"western antipodes\" (\"antipodibus occiduis\", letter of 14 May 1493),[6] the \"new hemisphere of the earth\" (\"novo terrarum hemisphaerio\", 13 September 1493),[7] and in a letter dated 1 November 1493, refers to Columbus as the \"discoverer of the new globe\" (\"Colonus ille novi orbis repertor\").[8] A year later (20 October 1494), Peter Martyr again refers to the marvels of the New Globe (\"Novo Orbe\") and the \"Western hemisphere\" (\"ab occidente hemisphero\").[9].\n",
