Her other film appearances include The Secret Garden (1993), Beyond the Clouds (1995), U.S. Marshals (1998), and Eternity (2016).. Irène Jacob was born in Suresnes, Hauts-de-Seine, a western suburb of Paris.[2] The youngest child with three older brothers, she was raised in a highly educated and intellectual family and environment: her father, Maurice Jacob, was a physicist; her mother, a psychologist; one brother, Francis Jacob, a musician; and her other two brothers, scientists.[3][4] In 1969, at the age of three, Irène moved with her family to Geneva, Switzerland, where she became interested in the arts.. My family was very shy with feelings and never spoke about them, but we evolved a little bit.\n",

      "Observation 1: Wendy Schaal (born July 2, 1954)[1] is an American actress known for her work in Joe Dante films such as Innerspace, The 'Burbs, and Small Soldiers. Her other film credits include starring in films such as Where the Boys Are '84, Creature, Going Under, and Munchies. She had many guest roles in television series of the mid-1980s, most notably as Marilyn Kelsy in Airwolf. Since 2005 she has primarily worked in voice acting, most notably voicing Francine Smith in the animated comedy television series American Dad!. Schaal was born in Chicago, Illinois, the daughter of Lois Schaal (née  Treacy) and actor Richard Schaal.[1] She is the former stepdaughter of actress Valerie Harper.[2] From birth until she was five, Schaal lived with her parents in Crete, Illinois, at which time she moved with her mother to Newport Beach, California after her parents divorced.[3] Schaal studied acting with Viola Spolin in Chicago when she was nine years old, later moving to Wisconsin and then California when she was 11.\n",

      "Observation 2: American Dad! is an American adult[2] animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane, Mike Barker, and Matt Weitzman for the Fox Broadcasting Company, and later TBS.[3][4] American Dad! is the first television series made to premiere on Fox's Animation Domination block.[5] The series premiered on February 6, 2005, following Super Bowl XXXIX, with the rest of the first season airing three months later beginning May 1, 2005.[6][7] American Dad! is a joint production between Underdog Productions, Fuzzy Door Productions and 20th Television Animation and syndicated by 20th Television.. Creative direction of American Dad! had largely been guided by Barker (prior to his departure from the show in season 10) and Weitzman as opposed to MacFarlane, resulting in a series that is different from its counterparts.[8] Unlike MacFarlane's other shows, Family Guy and, to a lesser extent, The Cleveland Show, American Dad! does not lean as heavily on the use of cutaway gags, and is less concerned with conventional \"setup-punchline\" jokes,[4] instead deriving its humor mostly from the quirky characters, the relationships between family members, and the relatively relatable plots.[3] While the core issues and resolutions are relatable in most episodes, the show nonetheless weaves in fantastical elements, pitching the tone of the show somewhere between observational comedy and farce.[4] The plots are often absurd, but grounded by family stories and real-world issues.[4]. American Dad! has been nominated for numerous awards, including four Primetime Emmy Awards and two Annie Awards. In June 2013, it was awarded as top television series by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. Since its debut, American Dad! has broadcast 334 episodes (as of September 26, 2022).\n",

There were many variants produced, often under license which ranged in length from 40 to 58 calibers, but 40 caliber was the most common version.. 6-pounders were widely used by the navies of a number of nations and often used by both sides in a conflict. Due to advances in torpedo delivery and performance, 6-pounder guns were rapidly made obsolete and were replaced with larger guns aboard most larger warships. This led to their being used ashore during World War I as coastal defense guns, the first tank guns and as anti-aircraft guns, whether on improvised or specialized HA/LA mounts.\n",
